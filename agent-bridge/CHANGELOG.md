# Changelog

## [6.0.3] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- **MCP data directory** — When the MCP process starts with cwd outside the repo (e.g. Cursor home) and no `NEOHIVE_DATA_DIR`, resolve the hive from repo `.cursor/mcp.json` / sibling config (`lib/resolve-server-data-dir.js`); `lib/config.js` uses the same root so agents and dashboard agree.
- **Dashboard `projects.json`** — Only rewrite the projects file when the canonical list differs from on-disk data (`pack(nonRedundant) !== pack(raw)`), not on every load when duplicates or default-hive rows were only present in the normalized pass-through list.

## [6.0.2] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Human agent mode** — users can join the team as a human agent via the dashboard
- **Agent card grid** — overview page shows agent cards with status, active tasks, and quick actions
- **Checkpoint system** — save and restore agent state snapshots for resumable work
- **Agent approval flow** — tasks can require explicit agent approval before advancing

### Fixed
- Message loss on SSE reconnect
- Token hijack race condition in `listen()`
- Spinlock in file-based task claiming
- Silent errors in workflow advancement
- Messages nav item flickering (switchView scope was too broad)
- Version strings synced to v6.0.0 across all files

### Changed
- Dashboard full visual rebrand — amber/gold NeoHive identity with icon rail, overview page, agent bar, and toast notifications
- Full layout redesign: icon rail sidebar, overview landing page, agent status bar

## [6.0.0] - 2026-04-02

### Breaking — Full Rebrand & Modularization

- **Renamed** — data directory migrated from `.agent-bridge/` → `.neohive/`; startup auto-migrates legacy directories
- **3D Hub removed** — Three.js virtual office, avatars, world builder, jukebox, and all 3D engine code removed; package size drops ~95%
- **Modularization** — core business logic extracted to `lib/` modules (`messaging`, `file-io`, `config`, `hooks`, `resolve-server-data-dir`, etc.)
- **Security hardening** — comprehensive audit: path traversal, XSS, CSRF, symlink, injection, and DoS fixes across dashboard and MCP server
- **New README** — professional redesign with badges, feature showcase, architecture diagram, and visual hierarchy
- **`.agent-bridge/` auto-migration** — startup detects and renames legacy data directory with zero data loss

## [5.3.0] - 2026-03-20

### Listen System Overhaul — Zero Token Waste

- **5-minute listen timeout** — `listen()` and `listen_group()` now block for 5 minutes (was 45s), reducing idle token overhead by 7x
- **fs.watch instant wake** — agents wake immediately when a message arrives, zero CPU/tokens while waiting
- **Fixed collectBatch bug** — file path was passed as branch name to `sanitizeName()`, breaking `listen_group()` on all platforms
- **Mode-aware instructions** — managed mode says `listen()`, group mode says `listen_group()`, all modes say "NEVER use sleep()"
- **Managed mode task tracking** — manager creates tasks/workflows, agents update status as they work (Tasks/Plan tabs stay current)
- **check_messages warns against loops** — response includes `action_required` telling agents to use `listen()` instead
- **listen_codex restricted** — description explicitly says "ONLY for Codex CLI, Claude/Gemini must use listen()"

## [5.2.6] - 2026-03-20

### Changed
- Managed mode guide updated — agents now track active tasks with `update_task` and advance workflows with `advance_workflow` as they work, keeping the Tasks/Plan tabs current in real time

## [5.2.5] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Token waste — `check_messages` response now includes `action_required` field warning agents to use `listen()` instead of polling loops
- `listen_codex` description explicitly restricted to Codex CLI only; Claude and Gemini agents must use `listen()`

## [5.2.4] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- All listen instruction strings updated to be mode-aware: managed mode instructs `listen()`, group mode instructs `listen_group()`, all modes say "NEVER use sleep()"

## [5.2.3] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Mode-aware listen instructions — each conversation mode now returns the correct listen command name in its guide

## [5.2.2] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Managed mode guide corrected — agents should call `listen()` (not `listen_group()`) between turns in managed mode

## [5.2.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- Managed mode guide corrected — agents should use `listen_group()` instead of sleep loops between turns

## [5.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Security Hardening (50+ fixes across 5 audit rounds)

- **Timing-safe** LAN token comparison (`crypto.timingSafeEqual`)
- **File permissions** — `.neohive/` created with `0o700`, `.lan-token` with `0o600`
- **XSS prevention** — `escapeHtml` escapes 6 characters, thread panel escaped, replay export `</script>` escaped, null byte placeholder collision fixed
- **Path traversal** — containment checks on `/lib/`, `/office/`, `/mods/` with `path.resolve`, mods asset write validated, conversation name regex
- **Rate limiting** — per-IP API rate limit (300/min), per-IP SSE limit (5), duplicate message detection, escalation broadcast rate limited
- **File locking** — tasks, workflows, channels all use `withFileLock`, PID-checked force-break, task claiming atomic
- **Input validation** — content type guards, stricter limits on some dashboard API bodies, agent name regex on all endpoints, avatar URL scheme validation
- **Security headers** — X-Frame-Options DENY, X-Content-Type-Options nosniff, Referrer-Policy no-referrer, CSP frame-ancestors none
- **Token removed** from all API responses, destructive endpoints require `confirm: true`
- **KB prompt injection** prevented — content in separate `reference_notes` field
- **share_file** denylist for .env, .pem, .key, credentials, data directory
- **Reserved names** — "Dashboard" blocked from agent registration
- **Manager claim** TOCTOU fixed with config lock

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Windows line endings** — all JSONL parsing uses `/\r?\n/` (24 sites fixed)
- **Portable config paths** — removed hardcoded absolute paths from env vars
- **Codex config backup** — creates `.backup` before modification
- Works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### New Features

- **Uninstall command** — `npx neohive uninstall` cleanly removes config entries from Claude/Gemini/Codex
- **Conversation management** — Clear Messages, New Conversation (archive + start fresh), Load saved conversations
- **Display names** — messages show profile display_name instead of raw registered name
- **Re-registration prevention** — agents can't change name mid-session

### Fixed

- 11 full-file read optimizations (tailReadJsonl)
- AI City environment removed from 3D Hub
- Test script updated (referenced deleted files)
- Node engine requirement updated to >=18.0.0
- Three.js updated to 0.175.0
- Tool count console message corrected (66 tools)
- SSE heartbeat `.unref()` added
- Monitor workspace log capped with safe fallback
- Edit history capped at 10 entries per message

## [4.3.0] - 2026-03-17

### Major — 3D Hub Game World, World Builder, Jukebox

Built by a 5-agent team (Architect, Builder, Tester, Optimizer, Protocol) working in parallel.

### Added — 3D Hub Game Features
- **World Builder** — Press B in player mode to open builder panel. 16 placeable assets across 5 categories (structural, furniture, decor, tech, lighting). Grid snap, ghost preview, R to rotate, right-click delete, Ctrl+Z undo. Draggable panel, works in fullscreen.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-03-17

### Major — Team Intelligence, Dashboard Upgrade, Performance

Built by a 4-agent team (Architect, Tester, Protocol, Builder) working in parallel.

### Added — Team Automation
- **Auto-escalation** — blocked tasks auto-broadcast `[ESCALATION]` to team after 5 minutes. File-based dedup via `task.escalated_at` field (cross-process safe). Clears on unblock.
- **Stand-up meetings** — config-driven periodic team check-ins (`standup_interval_hours` in config.json). File-based dedup, 5+ agent gate. Broadcasts task summary with in-progress/blocked/done counts.
- **Quality gates** — `update_task(done)` auto-broadcasts `[REVIEW NEEDED]` (from v4.1.0, now with auto-escalation integration).

### Added — Agent Intelligence
- **Workload metrics** — reputation tracks `task_times[]` (completion seconds), leaderboard shows `avg_task_time_sec` per agent.
- **Smarter suggest_task** — caps at 3 in-progress tasks ("finish first"), suggests blocked tasks when no pending ones, workload-aware.
- **KB hints in listen_group** — batch messages checked against KB keys, returns `kb_hints` with relevant entries.
- **Thread reply context** — `listen_group` includes `_reply_context` preview of parent message for threaded replies.
- **Decision overlap hints** — `send_message` checks content against logged decisions, returns `_decision_hint` to prevent re-debating.
- **Auto-status board** — `update_task` auto-writes `_status` to agent workspace ("Working on: X"). `list_agents` includes `current_status` field.

### Added — Dashboard
- **Agent intent display** — dashboard shows what each agent is currently working on (from workspace `_status`)
- **Channel badges** — messages show colored `#channel` badges
- **Channel filter bar** — horizontal scrollable tabs to filter messages by channel
- **Channel history merging** — `/api/history` merges channel-specific + general history files
- **`/api/channels` endpoint** — channel list with member counts for dashboard
- **`/api/decisions` endpoint** — decision log display in dashboard
- **Decision log UI** — chronological cards with topic, decision, reasoning, author

### Improved — Performance & Safety
- **Escalation dedup fix** — replaced in-memory `_escalatedTasks` Set with file-based `task.escalated_at` field (cross-process safe for 10 agents)
- **Dashboard current_status API** — `/api/agents` includes workspace `_status` for agent intent board

## [4.1.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added — Agent Reliability & Intelligence

- **Auto-recovery (crash resume)** — when an agent's process dies, the server snapshots its state (active tasks, locked files, channels, workspace keys, last 5 messages) to `recovery-{name}.json`. When a replacement registers with the same name, the snapshot is included in the register response with instructions to resume, not restart. 1-hour TTL, auto-deletes after load.
- **Quality gates** — `update_task(id, "done")` auto-broadcasts `[REVIEW NEEDED]` to all alive agents. Teams get automatic review cycles without manually calling `request_review()`.
- **Decision overlap hints** — `send_message` in group mode checks content against existing logged decisions. Returns `_decision_hint` if a related decision exists, preventing teams from re-debating settled topics.
- **Enhanced `check_messages`** — now returns rich summary: `senders`, `addressed_to_you`, `preview`, `urgency` level. The proactive counterpart to the enhanced nudge.

### Fixed
- **Recovery lock notes** — snapshot correctly labels locked files as `locked_files_released` with note that locks were auto-released.

## [4.0.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- 3D Hub empty on fresh installs — bundle Three.js as a proper npm dependency so it resolves from `node_modules` instead of relying on CDN

## [4.0.1] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- 3D Hub empty on fresh installs — load Three.js from CDN when `node_modules` is unavailable (interim fix before v4.0.2 bundled it properly)

## [4.0.0] - 2026-03-17

### Major Release — 10-Agent Free Group Mode

Massive scaling overhaul designed, implemented, and audited by a 3-agent team (Architect, Tester, Protocol). 12 changes, 3 bugs caught during collaborative code review.

### Added — Scaling (4 features)
- **Scaled context** — `listen_group` context window scales with team size: `min(50, max(20, agentCount * 5))`. 3 agents = 20 messages, 10 agents = 50.
- **Send-after-listen enforcement** — agents must call `listen_group()` between sends. Prevents message storms. Addressed agents get 2 sends per cycle, others get 1.
- **Response budget** — max 2 unaddressed sends per 60 seconds. Time-based reset. Hint (not error) when depleted.
- **Smart context with priority partitions** — Bucket A (addressed messages, sacred, always included), Bucket B (channel messages, capped), Bucket C (chronological, fills remaining). Total guaranteed <= contextSize.

### Added — Agent Awareness (3 features)
- **Enhanced nudge** — every non-listen tool response now includes sender names, addressed count, and message preview: `"URGENT: 3 messages waiting (2 addressed to you): 2 from Architect, 1 from Protocol. Latest: 'Need your review...'"`
- **Idle detection** — `listen_group()` returns `idle: true` after 60s with no messages, with proactive `work_suggestions`, task suggestions, and instructions. Agents auto-find work instead of blocking forever.
- **Enhanced `check_messages`** — now returns rich summary: `senders`, `addressed_to_you`, `preview`, `urgency` level. The proactive counterpart to the passive nudge.

### Added — Organization
- **Task-channel auto-binding** — with 5+ agents in group mode, `create_task` auto-creates `#task-{id}` channels. Assignees auto-join on claim. Channels auto-delete on task completion. Naturally splits 10-agent noise into focused sub-teams.

### Improved — Performance
- **Cached reads** — `getAgents()` (1.5s TTL), `getChannelsData()` (3s TTL), `getTasks()` (2s TTL) with write-through invalidation. Eliminates ~70% redundant disk I/O.
- **Compact JSON writes** — removed pretty-print (`null, 2`) from all internal JSON writes. 2-3x less I/O overhead.
- **Optimized agent status** — removed O(N) `getUnconsumedMessages` scan per agent in `listen_group` status computation.
- **Dashboard SSE race fix** — `Array.from()` before Set iteration prevents skipped clients during concurrent connect/disconnect.
- **Dashboard SSE heartbeat** — 30s keepalive prevents dead connection accumulation and proxy timeouts.
- **Dashboard file watcher cleanup** — old watcher properly closed on LAN toggle, prevents memory leaks.
- **Dashboard watcher filter** — only triggers on `.json`/`.jsonl` files, ignores lock files and temp files.

### Added — Safety
- **Collection caps** — tasks (1000), workflows (500), votes (500), reviews (500), dependencies (1000), branches (100), channels (100). Prevents DoS via unbounded growth.
- **Input type validation** — `reply_to` and `channel` parameters type-checked as strings in `send_message`.
- **Channel name validation fix** — error message corrected from "1-30 chars" to "1-20 chars" to match `sanitizeName()`.

## [3.10.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Stuck detector** — `listen_group()` detects when an agent has sent the same error or message pattern 3 times in a row and injects targeted hints to break the loop

## [3.10.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added — Dynamic Guide with Progressive Disclosure
- **`buildGuide()`** — replaces hardcoded guide in register() and get_guide(). Returns only rules relevant to the current system state.
- **Tiered rules:** Tier 0 (listen after every action), Tier 1 (core behavior), Tier 2 (group mode features), Tier 2b (channels), Tier 3 (large teams 5+)
- **User-customizable:** `.neohive/guide.md` for project-specific rules
- 2-agent direct mode = 5 rules. 10-agent group with channels = 12 rules.

## [3.9.1] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Per-channel cooldown** — uses channel member count instead of total agents. 2-member #backend = 1s, regardless of 10 in #general
- **`cooldown_applied_ms`** — diagnostic field in send_message response showing exact cooldown applied
- **`channel` field** in send_message response when sending to a channel

### Fixed
- Task race condition — `update_task` rejects claiming tasks already in_progress by another agent

## [3.9.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added — Channels & Split Cooldown

- **`join_channel(name, description?)`** — create or join a channel for sub-team communication
- **`leave_channel(name)`** — leave a channel (can't leave #general, empty channels auto-delete)
- **`list_channels()`** — list all channels with members, message counts, membership status
- **`send_message` channel parameter** — send to specific channel (`channel-{name}-messages.jsonl`)
- **`listen_group` reads all subscribed channels** — merges messages from general + channel files, sorted by timestamp
- **Channel validation** — sending to nonexistent channel returns error with hint to create it
- **Ghost member cleanup** — heartbeat auto-removes dead agents from channel membership
- **#general auto-created** — `members: ["*"]` (everyone), uses existing messages.jsonl for backward compat
- **Split cooldown (reply_to-based)** — fast lane (500ms) for addressed agents, slow lane (max 2000, N*1000) for unaddressed, incentivizes threading

### Fixed
- Task race condition — `update_task` now rejects claiming a task already in_progress by another agent, auto-assigns on claim

## [3.8.0] - 2026-03-16

### Changed — Group Conversation Overhaul

Redesigned from the ground up based on 3-agent collaborative testing and design session.

**Single-write group messages (O(1) instead of O(N)):**
- `send_message` in group mode now writes ONE message with `to: "__group__"` instead of N copies per agent
- `broadcast` in group mode also uses single `__group__` write
- Old O(N) auto-broadcast loop completely removed
- Result: with 6 agents, a message now creates 1 write instead of 6. A broadcast round that previously created 30 writes now creates 6.

**`addressed_to` field + `should_respond` hints:**
- `send_message(to="AgentName")` in group mode stores `addressed_to: ["AgentName"]` on the `__group__` message
- `listen_group` response includes `addressed_to_you: true/false` and `should_respond: true/false` per message
- Hint-based, not enforced — agents can still respond when they have valuable input
- No `addressed_to` = everyone should respond (backwards compatible)

**Adaptive cooldown:**
- Cooldown now scales with team size: `max(500ms, N * 500ms)` where N = alive agent count
- 2 agents = 1s, 3 agents = 1.5s, 6 agents = 3s, 10 agents = 5s
- Explicit `group_cooldown` config still respected if set

**Shorter stagger:**
- Deterministic stagger reduced from 0-3000ms to 500-1500ms
- Same agent always gets the same delay (hash-based)

**Alive-only garbage collection:**
- `autoCompact` for `__group__` messages only checks alive agents for consumed tracking
- Dead agents no longer block message compaction forever
- Dead agents catch up via `get_compressed_history()` which reads history.jsonl (never compacted)

**Own-message filtering:**
- Agents no longer see their own `__group__` messages in `listen_group` batches
- Own messages are auto-consumed on sight
- Own messages still visible in `context` array for reference

### Added — 3D World: Player Mode & Improvements
- **Player character** — users can spawn as a controllable character in the 3D Hub
- **Spectator camera improvements** — refined controls and speed
- **Environment updates** — campus environment refinements

## [3.7.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added — Agent Ecosystem (20 new tools, 52 total)

**Tier 1 — Critical Infrastructure:**
- **`get_briefing()`** — full project onboarding in one call: agents, tasks, decisions, KB, locked files, progress, project file tree
- **`lock_file(path)` / `unlock_file(path?)`** — exclusive file editing with auto-release on agent death
- **`log_decision(decision, reasoning?, topic?)` / `get_decisions(topic?)`** — persistent decision log, prevents re-debating
- **Agent recovery on rejoin** — `register()` returns active tasks, workspace keys, recent messages for returning agents

**Tier 2 — Quality of Life:**
- **`kb_write(key, content)` / `kb_read(key?)` / `kb_list()`** — shared team knowledge base (any agent reads/writes)
- **Event hooks** — auto-fires system messages on `agent_join`, `task_complete`, `all_tasks_done`, `dependency_met`
- **`update_progress(feature, percent, notes)` / `get_progress()`** — feature-level progress tracking with overall %
- **`get_compressed_history()`** — auto-compresses old messages into summary segments, keeps recent verbatim
- **`listen_group()` now blocks indefinitely** — no more timeout, agents never drop out

**Tier 3 — Advanced Collaboration:**
- **`call_vote(question, options)` / `cast_vote(vote_id, choice)` / `vote_status(vote_id?)`** — team voting with auto-resolve when all vote
- **`request_review(file, desc)` / `submit_review(review_id, status, feedback)`** — code review pipeline with approve/changes_requested
- **`declare_dependency(task_id, depends_on)` / `check_dependencies(task_id?)`** — task dependency tracking with auto-notify on resolve
- **`get_reputation(agent?)` / `suggest_task()`** — agent reputation tracking (auto-detects strengths), task suggestions based on skills
- **Auto-reputation tracking** — global hook tracks every action (messages, tasks, reviews, decisions, KB writes) without manual calls

### Fixed
- **Monitor screens stay red** when agent stops listening — persistent color state instead of 300ms flash
- **"NOT LISTENING" warning** shown prominently on desk monitor canvas
- **Status color logic** — green = listening, red = active but not listening, yellow = sleeping, dim = dead

## [3.6.2] - 2026-03-16

### Added — Message Awareness System
- **Sender gets busy status** — `send_message` and `broadcast` tell you when recipients are working (not listening) so you know messages are queued
- **Pending message nudge** — every non-listen tool call checks for unread messages and tells the agent to call `listen_group()` soon
- **Message age tracking** — `listen_group` shows `age_seconds` per message and `delayed: true` flag for messages older than 30s
- **Agent status in batch** — `listen_group` returns `agents_status` map showing who is `listening` vs `working`
- **listen_group retry** — timeout now returns `retry: true` with explicit instruction to call again immediately
- **next_action field** — successful `listen_group` response tells agent to call `listen_group()` again after responding
- **Ctrl key removed from camera** — no longer moves camera down (Q/E only)

### Added — 3D World: Campus Environment & Navigation
- **Campus environment** — new outdoor environment option with buildings, paths, green spaces
- **Navigation system** — pathfinding for agents to walk around obstacles instead of through walls
- **Door animations** — manager office door slides open when agents approach, closes when they leave
- **Roof visibility** — roof hides when camera is above ceiling height

## [3.6.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **3D Hub black screen on page load** — the office module loads asynchronously, but the initial `switchView('office')` fired before `office3dStart` was defined. Added auto-start at end of module so the 3D Hub loads immediately on refresh.

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added — Managed Conversation Mode

- **`set_conversation_mode("managed")`** — structured turn-taking for 3+ agent teams, prevents broadcast storms
- **`claim_manager()`** — claim the manager role (first caller wins, auto-election fallback)
- **`yield_floor(to, prompt?)`** — manager-only: give an agent permission to speak (directed, round-robin `__open__`, or close `__close__`)
- **`set_phase(phase)`** — manager-only: move team through discussion → planning → execution → review with auto-instructions to all agents
- **Floor enforcement** — `send_message`, `broadcast`, `handoff`, and `share_file` all block non-floor-holders with actionable error messages
- **Auto-advance turns** — floor returns to manager after directed responses; round-robin advances to next alive agent automatically
- **Manager disconnect recovery** — heartbeat detects dead manager within 10-30s, notifies all agents to re-elect
- **Dead turn-holder detection** — heartbeat detects dead agents holding the floor and resets it
- **Managed mode in `listen_group()`** — returns `managed_context`, `should_respond`, and `instructions` to guide agent behavior
- **`managed` template** — 4-agent team (Manager, Designer, Coder, Tester) with structured prompts
- **`managed-team` conversation template** — dashboard-launchable version
- **Dashboard Docs tab** — in-dashboard documentation with full tool reference, managed mode guide, architecture, version history
- **Dashboard managed mode badge** — header shows current phase and floor status when managed mode is active

- **Accessory system** — glasses, headwear, neckwear with color customization
- **Mod system infrastructure** — GLB/GLTF pipeline with validation

### Security
- **Config file lock** — `config.json` read-modify-write operations now use file-based locking (same pattern as `agents.json`)
- **Reserved name blocklist** — `__system__`, `__all__`, `__open__`, `__close__`, `system` cannot be registered as agent names
- **Mode change protection** — only the manager can switch away from managed mode
- **Floor enforcement on all message paths** — `handoff` and `share_file` now enforce managed mode floor control
- **Branch-aware system messages** — floor/phase notifications sent to recipient's branch, not sender's
- **Phase history cap** — limited to 50 entries to prevent config.json bloat
- `/office/*` and `/mods/*` static routes with path traversal protection
- Mod file type allowlist blocks all executable formats
- GLB magic bytes validation (server + client)

### Removed
- ~1,100 lines of dead 2D isometric office code

## [3.5.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added — Group Conversation Mode
- **`set_conversation_mode("group")`** — enables free multi-agent collaboration with auto-broadcast
- **`listen_group()`** — batch message receiver with random stagger (1-3s) to prevent simultaneous responses
- Returns ALL unconsumed messages + last 20 messages of context + hints about silent agents
- Auto-broadcast in group mode: every message is shared with all agents automatically
- Cooldown enforcement: agents must wait 3s between sends to maintain conversation flow
- Cascade prevention: broadcast copies don't trigger further broadcasts
- MCP tools: 27 → 29

### Added — Dashboard Features
- **Notification panel** — bell icon with badge count, dropdown event feed (agent online/offline, listening status changes)
- **Agent leaderboard** — performance scoring (0-100) with responsiveness, activity, reliability, collaboration dimensions
- **Cross-project search** — "All Projects" toggle in search bar, searches across all registered projects
- **Animated replay export** — Export conversation as self-playing HTML file with typing animations and play/pause controls
- **Ollama integration** — `npx neohive init --ollama` auto-detects Ollama, creates bridge script for local models

### Fixed — PID & Registration Integrity
- Registration file locking with try/finally (prevents race conditions when multiple agents register simultaneously)
- PID stale detection uses `last_activity` with 30s threshold (prevents false "alive" from Windows PID reuse)
- Lock file cleaned up on process exit
- Dashboard inject/nudge snapshots project context at click time (prevents wrong-project race)

### Security
- `toolHandoff` and workflow auto-handoff now check `canSendTo` permissions
- `lastSentAt` updated in `toolBroadcast` (prevents cooldown bypass)
- `config.json` added to both server and dashboard reset cleanup
- Auto-broadcast respects `canSendTo` per recipient

## [3.4.4] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Add project now accepts any existing directory (removed requirement for package.json or .git)
- Init safely backs up corrupted .mcp.json and settings.json before overwriting

### Changed
- Removed plugin references from website and docs
- Website updated with security features (LAN auth token, CSRF, CSP)

## [3.4.3] - 2026-03-15

### Removed — Plugin System
- Removed the entire plugin system (`vm.runInNewContext` sandbox, plugin CLI commands, dashboard plugin UI)
- **Why:** Plugins were an unnecessary attack surface. Node.js `vm` is not a security sandbox — plugins could escape and execute arbitrary OS commands. CLI terminals (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex) have their own extension systems, making our plugins redundant.
- `npx neohive plugin` now shows a deprecation notice
- MCP tools reduced from 27 + plugins to 27 (all core tools remain)
- ~200 lines of code removed from server.js, cli.js, dashboard.js, dashboard.html

## [3.4.2] - 2026-03-15

### Security — CSRF Protection
- Required `X-LTT-Request` custom header on all POST/PUT/DELETE requests
- `lttFetch` wrapper in dashboard automatically includes the header
- Malicious cross-origin pages cannot set custom headers without CORS preflight approval
- Removed wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` in LAN mode — now uses explicit trusted origins only
- Empty Origin/Referer no longer auto-trusted — requires custom header as minimum protection

### Security — LAN Auth Token
- Auto-generated 32-char hex token when LAN mode is enabled
- Token required for all non-localhost requests (via `?token=` query param or `X-LTT-Token` header)
- Token included in QR code URL — phone scans and it just works
- Token displayed in phone access modal with explanation
- New token generated each time LAN mode is toggled on
- Token persists across server restarts via `.lan-token` file
- Localhost access never requires a token

### Security — Content Security Policy
- CSP header added to dashboard HTML response
- `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` for inline handlers, blocks `eval()` and external scripts
- `connect-src 'self'` restricts API calls to same origin
- `font-src`, `style-src`, `img-src` scoped to required sources only

### Fixed
- CSRF brace imbalance that trapped GET handlers inside POST-only block
- LAN token not forwarded from phone URL to API calls and SSE
- Redundant nested origin check collapsed to single condition

## [3.4.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **File-level mutex** — in-memory promise queue per file for serializing edit/delete operations
- **Agent permissions enforcement** — `canSendTo()` checks in `send_message` and `broadcast`, `can_read` filtering in `get_history` and message delivery
- **Read receipts** — auto-recorded when agents consume messages, visible as agent-initial dots under messages in dashboard

### Security
- HTTP 500 responses now return generic error instead of raw `err.message` (prevents filesystem path leaks)
- `/api/discover` changed from GET to POST (now under CSRF protection)
- `workspace_read`/`workspace_list` validate agent name parameter with regex
- `get_history` filters results by agent's `can_read` permissions
- `read_receipts.json` and `permissions.json` added to both MCP and dashboard reset cleanup
- Dashboard workspace API regex aligned with server (`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`)

### Fixed
- `toolWaitForReply` missing `markAsRead` calls (read receipts not recorded)
- `toolBroadcast` bypassing permission checks entirely
- `toolReset` not cleaning up `permissions.json` and `read_receipts.json`

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added — Dashboard Features
- **Stats Tab** — per-agent message counts, avg response time, peak hours, 24-hour activity chart, conversation velocity. Keyboard shortcut `6`.
- **Compact View** — toggle button in search bar. Hides avatars, inlines timestamps, reduces padding. Persists to localStorage.
- **Message Edit** — edit any message via hover action. Full edit history tracked, "edited" badge displayed.
- **Message Delete** — delete dashboard/system messages with confirmation dialog.
- **Copy Message** — clipboard button on message hover to copy raw content.
- **JSON Export** — new export format alongside HTML and Markdown.
- **Kanban Drag-and-Drop** — drag task cards between columns (pending/in_progress/done/blocked).
- **SSE Auto-Reconnect** — exponential backoff (1s→30s), yellow "Reconnecting..." indicator, polling fallback.
- **Conversation Templates** — 4 built-in multi-agent workflow templates (Code Review Pipeline, Debug Squad, Feature Development, Research & Write) in the Launch tab with copyable agent prompts.

### Added — API Endpoints

- `POST /api/conversation-templates/launch` — get template agent prompts
- `GET /api/stats` — analytics data (per-agent stats, velocity, hourly distribution)
- `GET/POST /api/permissions` — agent permission management

### Added — CLI Commands
- `npx neohive msg <agent> <text>` — send a message from CLI

- Focus rings on all inputs
- Smoother transitions (0.2-0.25s) with lift effects on hover
- Glass effects on modals and popups
- Inset shadows on code blocks
- Thinner scrollbars with transparent tracks

### Fixed
- Task notes crash when `notes` array undefined
- Message edit always rewrites messages.jsonl regardless of match
- Permissions API accepted arbitrary fields (now whitelisted)
- Task status accepted any string (now validated against whitelist)
- Reset button ignored active project in multi-project mode
- Edit modal missing error handler on network failure
- CLI msg command accepted invalid agent names
- Copy-to-clipboard double-escaped HTML entities in template prompts
- Duplicate deleteMessage function shadowing

## [3.3.3] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- iOS dashboard crash — `Notification` API unavailable on iOS Safari; wrapped in availability check
- Mobile UI overhaul — layout, font sizes, and button targets reworked for phone-sized screens
